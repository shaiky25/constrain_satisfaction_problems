## üß† CSP Concepts Explained

### What are Constraint Satisfaction Problems?
CSPs are mathematical problems defined as a set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations. They consist of:

- **Variables**: Objects that need values assigned
- **Domains**: Possible values for each variable
- **Constraints**: Rules that limit value combinations

### Common CSP Problems
1. **Map Coloring**: Color regions so adjacent areas have different colors
2. **Sudoku**: Fill a 9√ó9 grid with numbers following specific rules
3. **N-Queens**: Place N queens on an N√óN chessboard without conflicts
4. **Scheduling**: Assign tasks to time slots with resource constraints

### AI Techniques Used

#### Backtracking
- **How it works**: Systematically tries different value assignments
- **When to backtrack**: When a constraint is violated
- **Complexity**: O(d^n) where d is domain size, n is number of variables

#### Forward Checking
- **Improvement**: Removes inconsistent values from unassigned variables
- **Benefit**: Reduces search space early
- **Use case**: When you want to fail fast

#### Arc Consistency (AC-3)
- **Process**: Ensures every value has compatible values in other variables
- **Complexity**: O(d¬≥n¬≤)
- **Advantage**: Stronger pruning than forward checking

#### Genetic Algorithm
- **Inspiration**: Natural selection and evolution
- **Process**: Population of solutions evolves over generations
- **Best for**: Large, complex problems where exact solutions are hard to find
